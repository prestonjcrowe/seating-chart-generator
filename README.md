# seating-chart-generator
A small Processing application to create and save custom seating charts, made for Mr. McSorely during my senior year.
To use, add all student names to names.txt in the sketch folder. Adjust the 'cols' and 'rows' attributes to reflect
the number of seats in your classroom. In the setup state, click and drag to toggle desks on and off and recreate the exact
layout of your classroom or press m to load preset .csv file containing desk locations. In placement state: a and z will arange 
names in alphabetical and reverse alphabetical order, r will randomize, and s will save the current layout as a .png in the
sketch folder. Select two desks to swap their students, or press enter to edit the selected desk's name value.
